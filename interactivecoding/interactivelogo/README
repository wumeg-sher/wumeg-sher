This is an interactive logo for my personal brand. 
Interactivity elements:
    - The cat's head is draggable 
    - clicking the letter g will reset the cat to its original position 
    - clicking the cat's eyes or the letter i will cause the cat to blink 
    - clicking the letter m twice will play a small animation


further project goals:
    - make the m click interaction more robust
    - include an interactivity element for the letter e (maybe a "meow" sound that plays)
    - make it more clear that the letters are meant to be interacted with 
    - adding stylization/shadows
